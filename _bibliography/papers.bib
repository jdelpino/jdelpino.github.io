	  abstract     = {The combination of a strong pump and a weak probe has been widely applied to investigate both optical and nanomechanical devices. Such pump-probe measurements allows for the exploration of nonlinear dynamics, driven by the large pump tone, by measuring the system response to a probe tone. In contrast, here we report on the dynamics of a mechanical Duffing resonator driven with a combination of two large tones at different frequencies. Our results indicate the presence of various distinct regimes with very different dynamics. We systematically investigate the impact of the relative strength and detuning between the two drives on the dynamical response. This provides an illustrative example of dynamical phase transitions in out-of-equilibrium systems.}

We experimentally demonstrate the emergence of quantum-Hall-like chiral edge states in optomechanical resonator networks. Synthetic magnetic fields for phononic excitations are induced through laser drives, while cavity optomechanical control allows full reconfigurability of the effective metamaterial response of the networks, including programming of magnetic fluxes in multiple resonator plaquettes. By tuning the interplay between network connectivity and magnetic fields, we demonstrate both flux-sensitive and flux-insensitive localized mechanical states. Scaling up the system creates spectral features that are precursors to Hofstadter butterfly spectra. Site-resolved spectroscopy reveals edge-bulk separation, with stationary phononic distributions signaling chiral edge modes. We directly probe those edge modes in transport measurements to demonstrate a unidirectional acoustic channel. This work unlocks new ways of controlling topological phononic phases at the nanoscale with applications in noise management and information processing.}

Specifically, we focus on the formation of a limit cycle manifesting as a phononic frequency comb. Utilizing a pump-noisy-probe technique and theoretical modeling, we reveal the behavior of mechanical excitations revealing themselves as sidebands of the stationary IR response. We find that when the energy-absorbing excitation of a lower mode is parametrically-upconverted to hybridize with a higher mode, significant squeezing and bimodality in the upper mode occurs. Instead, when the upconverted absorbing excitation hybridizes with an emitting sideband of the higher mode, a Hopf bifurcation occurs and a limit cycle forms, manifesting as a frequency comb. We thus reveal a unique mechanism to obtain frequency combs in parametrically-coupled modes. We furthermore demonstrate a rich variety of IR effects, the origin of which significantly extends beyond standard linear parametric coupling phenomena. Our findings enhance the understanding of energy transfer mechanisms with implications for advanced sensing technologies and novel phononic metamaterials}

	  abstract={In topology, one averages over local geometrical details to reveal robust global features. This approach proves crucial for understanding quantized bulk transport and exotic boundary effects of linear wave propagation in (meta-)materials. Moving beyond linear Hamiltonian systems, the study of topology in physics strives to characterize open (non-Hermitian) and interacting systems. Here, we establish a framework for the topological classification of driven-dissipative nonlinear systems. Specifically, we define a graph index for the Floquet semiclassical equations of motion describing such systems. The graph index builds upon topological vector analysis theory and combines knowledge of the particle-hole nature of fluctuations around each out-of-equilibrium stationary state. To test this approach, we divulge the topological invariants arising in a micro-electromechanical nonlinear resonator subject to forcing and a time-modulated potential. Our framework classifies the complete phase diagram of the system and reveals the topological origin of driven-dissipative phase transitions, as well as that of under- to over-damped responses. Furthermore, we predict topological phase transitions between symmetry-broken phases that pertain to population inversion transitions. This rich manifesting phenomenology reveals the pervasive link between topology and nonlinear dynamics, with broad implications for all fields of science.},

Their exceptional properties, such as low mass and high quality factor, make them also very appealing for force sensing experiments. In this Letter, we propose a method for detecting and ultimately controlling nuclear spins by directly coupling them to high-frequency resonators via a magnetic field gradient. Dynamical backaction between the sensor and an ensemble of nuclear spins produces a shift in the sensor's resonance frequency, which can be measured to probe the spin ensemble. Based on analytical as well as numerical results, we predict that the method will allow nanoscale magnetic resonance imaging with a range of realistic devices. At the same time, this interaction paves the way for new manipulation techniques, similar to those employed in cavity optomechanics, enriching both the sensor's and the spin ensemble's features.}

We report the experimental realization of its bosonic analogue2 in a nano-optomechanical network, in which the parametric interactions induce beam-splitter coupling and two-mode squeezing among the nanomechanical modes, analogous to hopping and p-wave pairing in the fermionic case, respectively. This specific structure gives rise to a set of extraordinary phenomena in the bosonic dynamics and transport. We observe quadrature-dependent chiral amplification, exponential scaling of the gain with system size and strong sensitivity to boundary conditions. All these are linked to the unique non-Hermitian topological nature of the bosonic Kitaev chain. We probe the topological phase transition and uncover a rich dynamical phase diagram by controlling interaction phases and amplitudes. Finally, we present an experimental demonstration of an exponentially enhanced response to a small perturbation3,4. These results represent the demonstration of a new synthetic phase of matter whose bosonic dynamics do not have fermionic parallels, and we have established a powerful system for studying non-Hermitian topology and its applications for signal manipulation and sensing.},

  abstract     = {Nonreciprocity means that the transmission of a signal depends on its direction of propagation. Despite vastly different platforms and underlying working principles, the realisations of nonreciprocal transport in linear, time-independent systems rely on Aharonov-Bohm interference among several pathways and require breaking time-reversal symmetry. Here we extend the notion of nonreciprocity to unidirectional bosonic transport in systems with a time-reversal symmetric Hamiltonian by exploiting interference between beamsplitter (excitation preserving) and two-mode-squeezing (excitation non-preserving) interactions. In contrast to standard nonreciprocity, this unidirectional transport manifests when the mode quadratures are resolved with respect to an external reference phase. Hence we dub this phenomenon quadrature nonreciprocity. First, we experimentally demonstrate it in the minimal system of two coupled nanomechanical modes orchestrated by optomechanical interactions. Next, we develop a theoretical framework to characterise the class of networks exhibiting quadrature nonreciprocity based on features of their particle-hole graphs. In addition to unidirectionality, these networks can exhibit an even-odd pairing between collective quadratures, which we confirm experimentally in a four-mode system, and an exponential end-to-end gain in the case of arrays of cavities. Our work opens up new avenues for signal routing and quantum-limited amplification in bosonic systems.},

  abstract = {A limit cycle is a self-sustained, periodic, isolated motion appearing in autonomous differential equations. As the period of a limit cycle is a priori unknown, finding it as a stationary state of a rotating ansatz is challenging. Correspondingly, its study commonly relies on numerical methodologies (e.g., brute-force time evolution, and variational shooting methods) or circumstantial evidence such as instabilities of fixed points. Alas, such approaches are (i) unable to find all solutions, as they rely on specific initial conditions, and (ii) do not provide analytical intuition about the physical origin of the limit cycles. Here, we (I) develop a multifrequency rotating ansatz with which we (II) find all limit cycles as stationary-state solutions via a semianalytical homotopy continuation. We demonstrate our approach and its performance on the Van der Pol oscillator. Moving beyond this simple example, we show that our method captures all coexisting fixed-point attractors and limit cycles in a modified nonlinear Van der Pol oscillator. Our results facilitate the systematic mapping of out-of-equilibrium phase diagrams, with implications across multiple fields of the natural sciences.},

In particular, networks of Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) are envisioned as simulators for finding the ground states of Ising Hamiltonians. It was shown, however, that KPO networks can feature large numbers of unexpected solutions that are difficult to sample with the existing deterministic (i.e., adiabatic) protocols. In this work, we experimentally realize a system of two classical coupled KPOs, and we find good agreement with the predicted mapping to Ising states. We then introduce a protocol based on stochastic sampling of the system, and we show how the resulting probability distribution can be used to identify the ground state of the corresponding Ising Hamiltonian. This method is akin to a Monte Carlo sampling of multiple out-of-equilibrium stationary states and is less prone to become trapped in local minima than deterministic protocols.}

We find that the enhancement of nonlinear optomechanical coupling in the MIM system as predicted by Ludwig et al (2012 Phys. Rev.

Moreover, we show that the selectivity of the MIM system of nonlinear over linear transduction has the same limit as in a single cavity system. These findings put constraints on the experiments in which it is advantageous to use an MIM system. We discuss dynamical backaction effects in this system and find that these effects per cavity photon are exactly as strong as in a single cavity system, while allowing for reduction of the required input power.

	abstract     = {Conventional approaches to probing ultrafast molecular dynamics rely on the use of synchronized laser pulses with a well-defined time delay. Typically, a pump pulse excites a molecular wavepacket. A subsequent probe pulse can then dissociate or ionize the molecule, and measurement of the molecular fragments provides information about where the wavepacket was for each time delay. Here, we propose to exploit the ultrafast nuclear-position-dependent emission obtained due to large light–matter coupling in plasmonic nanocavities to image wavepacket dynamics using only a single pump pulse. We show that the time-resolved emission from the cavity provides information about when the wavepacket passes a given region in nuclear configuration space. This approach can image both cavity-modified dynamics on polaritonic (hybrid light–matter) potentials in the strong light–matter coupling regime and bare-molecule dynamics in the intermediate coupling regime of large Purcell enhancements, and provides a route towards ultrafast molecular spectroscopy with plasmonic nanocavities.},

	abstract     = {We demonstrate an optomechanical platform where optical mode conversion mediated by mechanical motion enables the arbitrary tailoring of polarization states of propagating light fields. Optomechanical interactions are realized in a Fabry-P{\'{e}}rot resonator, which naturally supports two polarization-degenerate states while an optical control field induces rotational symmetry breaking. Applying such principles, the entire Poincar{\'{e}} sphere is spanned by just optical control of the driving field, realizing reciprocal and nonreciprocal optomechanically induced birefringence for linearly polarized and circularly polarized control driving. A straightforward extension of this setup also enables all-optical tunable isolation and circulation. Our findings open new avenues to exploit optomechanics for the arbitrary manipulation of light polarization.},

	abstract     = {In the regime of strong coupling between molecular excitons and confined optical modes, the intramolecular degrees of freedom are profoundly affected, leading to a reduced vibrational dressing of polaritons compared to bare electronically excited states. However, existing models only describe a single vibrational mode in each molecule, while actual molecules possess a large number of vibrational degrees of freedom and additionally interact with a continuous bath of phononic modes in the host medium in typical experiments. In this work, we investigate a small ensemble of molecules with an arbitrary number of vibrational degrees of freedom under strong coupling to a microcavity mode. We demonstrate that reduced vibrational dressing is still present in this case, and show that the influence of the phononic environment on most electronic and photonic observables in the lowest excited state can be predicted from just two collective parameters of the vibrational modes. Besides, we explore vibrational features that can be addressed exclusively by our extended model and could be experimentally tested. Our findings indicate that vibronic coupling is more efficiently suppressed for environments characterized by low-frequency (sub-Ohmic) modes.},

By using different models within linear response theory, we show that the total Raman cross section is maintained constant when the system evolves from the weak-coupling limit to the strong-coupling regime. A redistribution of the Raman signal among the two polaritons is the main fingerprint of vibrational strong coupling in the Raman spectrum.},

By employing a Bloch-Redfield-Wangsness approach, we show that the influence of dephasing-type interactions, i.e., elastic collisions with a background bath of phonons, critically depends on the nature of the bath modes. In particular, for long-range phonons corresponding to a common bath, the dynamics of the 'bright state' (the collective superposition of molecular vibrations coupling to the cavity mode) is effectively decoupled from other system eigenStates. For the case of independent baths (or short-range phonons), incoherent energy transfer occurs between the bright state and the uncoupled dark States. However, these processes are suppressed when the Rabi splitting is larger than the frequency range of the bath modes, as achieved in a recent experiment (Shalabney et al 2015 Nat. Commun. 6 5981). In both cases, the dynamics can thus be described through a single collective oscillator coupled to a photonic mode, making this system an ideal candidate to explore cavity optomechanics at room temperature.},

We also prove that entanglement manifests itself in far-field images of the plasmonic modes, through the statistics of the quadratures of the field, in what constitutes a novel family of entanglement witnesses.
