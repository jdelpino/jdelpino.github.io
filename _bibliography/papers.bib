	  abstract = {In driven-dissipative bosonic systems, the interplay between coherent driving, inter-particle interactions and dissipation leads to a rich variety of non-equilibrium stationary states (NESS). In the semiclassical limit, the flow topology of phase-space dynamics governs the stability and structure of these dynamical phases. Consequently, topological transitions occur when the number of NESS, their chirality, or their connectivity changes, reflecting global reorganization in the system's dynamical phase-space landscape. Here, we study the corresponding topological signatures in a driven-dissipative quantum Kerr oscillator. Employing a Lindblad master equation and quantum trajectory methods, we reveal that quantum dynamics retain key topological features of the underlying classical flows, with clear signatures accessible via quantum state tomography and linear response. In this manner, we predict new phases that are not signaled by Liouvillian gap closing, thereby generalizing the conventional criteria for diagnosing phase transitions. Our findings position phase-space flow topology as a powerful tool to identify and control robust quantum phases, enabling advances in error correction and sensing.},

	  abstract = {Mechanical resonators operating in the megahertz range have become a versatile platform for fundamental and applied quantum research. Their exceptional properties, such as low mass and high quality factor, make them also appealing for force sensing experiments. In this work, we propose a method for detecting, and ultimately controlling, nuclear spins by coupling them to megahertz resonators via a magnetic field gradient. Dynamical backaction between the sensor and an ensemble of N nuclear spins produces a shift in the sensor's resonance frequency. The mean frequency shift due to the Boltzmann polarization is challenging to measure in nanoscale sample volumes. Here, we show that the fluctuating polarization of the spin ensemble results in a measurable increase of the resonator's frequency variance. On the basis of analytical as well as numerical results, we predict that the variance measurement will allow single nuclear spin detection with existing resonator devices.}

These are crucial in physics for understanding quantized bulk transport and exotic boundary effects of linear wave propagation in (meta-)materials. Beyond linear Hamiltonian systems, topological physics strives to characterize open (non-Hermitian) and interacting systems. Here, we establish a framework for the topological classification of driven-dissipative nonlinear systems by defining a graph index for their Floquet semiclassical equations of motion. Our index builds upon the topology of vector flows and encodes the particle-hole nature of excitations around all out-of-equilibrium stationary states. Thus, we uncover the topology of nonlinear resonator’s dynamics under external and parametric forcing. Our framework sheds light on the topology of driven-dissipative phases, including under- to overdamped responses and symmetry-broken phases linked to population inversion. We therefore expose the pervasive link between topology and nonlinear dynamics, with broad implications for interacting topological insulators, topological solitons, neuromorphic networks, and bosonic codes.}

Specifically, we focus on the formation of a limit cycle (LC) manifesting as a phononic frequency comb. As the LC formation involves a Hopf bifurcation, we developed a dedicated pump-noisy-probe technique to investigate which mechanical sidebands merge at the bifurcation. We reveal that the sideband of the driven lower mode is up-converted via a cross-Duffing nonlinearity to hybridize with the undriven high mode. When the up-conversion is initially red detuned relative to the high mode, significant squeezing and bimodality in the high mode occurs. Crucially, only when the up-converted sideband is initially blue detuned relative to the high mode, the sideband is attracted to the high mode and merges to form the Hopf bifurcation. This process delineates the microscopic origin of frequency comb formation. Our study reveals a key instability mechanism in driven nonlinear systems with implications for advanced sensing technologies and phononic metamaterials.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear dynamics are studied in diverse fields as climate models, avalanches, nanomechanical sensors, optical frequency converters, and electrical quantum amplifiers. A widely studied nonlinear model is the so-called Duffing (or Kerr) resonator, which features a quartic potential term. Two hallmark properties of this model are (i) a shift of a system's resonance frequency as a function of the driving strength, and (ii) monostable or bistable responses, depending on the drive strength and detuning from resonance. Together, these two properties can lead to dynamical phase transitions when several drives are applied simultaneously. Here, we report an experimental and theoretical study of a driven-dissipative nonlinear system with two detuned drives. We observe distinct response regimes characterized by the system's ability to follow the system's time-dependent vector-flow topology. Our work provides an example for understanding dynamical phase transitions in out-of-equilibrium nonlinear systems.}

  abstract = {A limit cycle is a self-sustained, periodic, isolated motion appearing in autonomous differential equations. As the period of a limit cycle is a priori unknown, finding it as a stationary state of a rotating ansatz is challenging. Correspondingly, its study commonly relies on numerical methodologies (e.g., brute-force time evolution, and variational shooting methods) or circumstantial evidence such as instabilities of fixed points. Alas, such approaches are (i) unable to find all solutions, as they rely on specific initial conditions, and (ii) do not provide analytical intuition about the physical origin of the limit cycles. Here, we (I) develop a multifrequency rotating ansatz with which we (II) find all limit cycles as stationary-state solutions via a semianalytical homotopy continuation. We demonstrate our approach and its performance on the Van der Pol oscillator. Moving beyond this simple example, we show that our method captures all coexisting fixed-point attractors and limit cycles in a modified nonlinear Van der Pol oscillator. Our results facilitate the systematic mapping of out-of-equilibrium phase diagrams, with implications across multiple fields of the natural sciences.},

We report the experimental realization of its bosonic analogue2 in a nano-optomechanical network, in which the parametric interactions induce beam-splitter coupling and two-mode squeezing among the nanomechanical modes, analogous to hopping and p-wave pairing in the fermionic case, respectively. This specific structure gives rise to a set of extraordinary phenomena in the bosonic dynamics and transport. We observe quadrature-dependent chiral amplification, exponential scaling of the gain with system size and strong sensitivity to boundary conditions. All these are linked to the unique non-Hermitian topological nature of the bosonic Kitaev chain. We probe the topological phase transition and uncover a rich dynamical phase diagram by controlling interaction phases and amplitudes. Finally, we present an experimental demonstration of an exponentially enhanced response to a small perturbation3,4. These results represent the demonstration of a new synthetic phase of matter whose bosonic dynamics do not have fermionic parallels, and we have established a powerful system for studying non-Hermitian topology and its applications for signal manipulation and sensing.},

  abstract     = {Nonreciprocity means that the transmission of a signal depends on its direction of propagation. Despite vastly different platforms and underlying working principles, the realisations of nonreciprocal transport in linear, time-independent systems rely on Aharonov-Bohm interference among several pathways and require breaking time-reversal symmetry. Here we extend the notion of nonreciprocity to unidirectional bosonic transport in systems with a time-reversal symmetric Hamiltonian by exploiting interference between beamsplitter (excitation preserving) and two-mode-squeezing (excitation non-preserving) interactions. In contrast to standard nonreciprocity, this unidirectional transport manifests when the mode quadratures are resolved with respect to an external reference phase. Hence we dub this phenomenon quadrature nonreciprocity. First, we experimentally demonstrate it in the minimal system of two coupled nanomechanical modes orchestrated by optomechanical interactions. Next, we develop a theoretical framework to characterise the class of networks exhibiting quadrature nonreciprocity based on features of their particle-hole graphs. In addition to unidirectionality, these networks can exhibit an even-odd pairing between collective quadratures, which we confirm experimentally in a four-mode system, and an exponential end-to-end gain in the case of arrays of cavities. Our work opens up new avenues for signal routing and quantum-limited amplification in bosonic systems.},

These systems are colloquially known as “Ising machines.” We experimentally and theoretically study such a network under the influence of an external force. The force breaks the collective phase-parity symmetry of the system and competes with the intrinsic coupling in ordering the network configuration, similar to how a magnetic field biases an interacting spin ensemble. Specifically, we demonstrate how the force can be used to control the system, and highlight the crucial role of the phase and symmetry of the force. Our Letter thereby provides a method to create Ising machines with arbitrary bias, extending even to exotic cases that are impossible to engineer in real spin systems.}

In this work, we experimentally realize a system of two classical coupled KPOs, and we find good agreement with the predicted mapping to Ising states. We then introduce a protocol based on stochastic sampling of the system, and we show how the resulting probability distribution can be used to identify the ground state of the corresponding Ising Hamiltonian.

We observe chiral energy flow among mechanical resonators in a synthetic dimension and Aharonov-Bohm tuning of their hybridised modes.

Moreover, we show that the selectivity of the MIM system of nonlinear over linear transduction has the same limit as in a single cavity system. These findings put constraints on the experiments in which it is advantageous to use an MIM system. We discuss dynamical backaction effects in this system and find that these effects per cavity photon are exactly as strong as in a single cavity system, while allowing for reduction of the required input power. We propose using the nonlinear enhancement and reduced input power in realistic MIM systems towards parametric squeezing and heralding of phonon pairs, and evaluate the limits to the magnitude of both effects.},

Nanomechanical systems are applied as sensors and in signal processing, and feature strong nonlinearities. Gauge potentials acting on such systems could induce quantum Hall physics for phonons at the nanoscale. Here, we demonstrate a magnetic gauge field for nanomechanical vibrations in a scalable, on-chip optomechanical system. We induce the gauge field through multi-mode optomechanical interactions, which have been proposed as a resource for the necessary breaking of time-reversal symmetry2–4. In a dynamically modulated nanophotonic system, we observe how radiation pressure forces mediate phonon transport between resonators of different frequencies. The resulting controllable interaction, which is characterized by a high rate and nonreciprocal phase, mimics the Aharonov–Bohm effect5. We show that the introduced scheme does not require high-quality cavities, such that it allows exploring topological acoustic phases in many-mode systems resilient to realistic disorder.},

Typically, a pump pulse excites a molecular wavepacket. A subsequent probe pulse can then dissociate or ionize the molecule, and measurement of the molecular fragments provides information about where the wavepacket was for each time delay. Here, we propose to exploit the ultrafast nuclear-position-dependent emission obtained due to large light–matter coupling in plasmonic nanocavities to image wavepacket dynamics using only a single pump pulse. We show that the time-resolved emission from the cavity provides information about when the wavepacket passes a given region in nuclear configuration space. This approach can image both cavity-modified dynamics on polaritonic (hybrid light–matter) potentials in the strong light–matter coupling regime and bare-molecule dynamics in the intermediate coupling regime of large Purcell enhancements, and provides a route towards ultrafast molecular spectroscopy with plasmonic nanocavities.},

However, existing models only describe a single vibrational mode in each molecule, while actual molecules possess a large number of vibrational degrees of freedom and additionally interact with a continuous bath of phononic modes in the host medium in typical experiments. In this work, we investigate a small ensemble of molecules with an arbitrary number of vibrational degrees of freedom under strong coupling to a microcavity mode. We demonstrate that reduced vibrational dressing is still present in this case, and show that the influence of the phononic environment on most electronic and photonic observables in the lowest excited state can be predicted from just two collective parameters of the vibrational modes. Besides, we explore vibrational features that can be addressed exclusively by our extended model and could be experimentally tested. Our findings indicate that vibronic coupling is more efficiently suppressed for environments characterized by low-frequency (sub-Ohmic) modes.},

By employing a Bloch-Redfield-Wangsness approach, we show that the influence of dephasing-type interactions, i.e., elastic collisions with a background bath of phonons, critically depends on the nature of the bath modes. In particular, for long-range phonons corresponding to a common bath, the dynamics of the 'bright state' (the collective superposition of molecular vibrations coupling to the cavity mode) is effectively decoupled from other system eigenStates. For the case of independent baths (or short-range phonons), incoherent energy transfer occurs between the bright state and the uncoupled dark States. However, these processes are suppressed when the Rabi splitting is larger than the frequency range of the bath modes, as achieved in a recent experiment (Shalabney et al 2015 Nat. Commun. 6 5981). In both cases, the dynamics can thus be described through a single collective oscillator coupled to a photonic mode, making this system an ideal candidate to explore cavity optomechanics at room temperature.},
