#### Artificial Gauge Fields and Nonreciprocal Transport

**_Can we make light or sound behave as if they feel a magnetic field?_**

**_What happens when we break time symmetry to make energy flow in one direction?_**

**_How can gain, loss, and topology work together to control signals in quantum systems?_**

**Gauge fields** are at the heart of how we understand forces in nature—they describe how particles interact, from electromagnetism to the strong and weak nuclear forces. In condensed matter systems, **external gauge fields** like magnetic fields play a key role in shaping the behavior of electrons. A famous example is the **quantum Hall effect**, where applying a magnetic field to a two-dimensional electron gas leads to current flowing only along the edges, in one direction, while the bulk remains insulating. This remarkable behavior results from breaking **time-reversal symmetry** and gives rise to **topological edge states** that are robust against imperfections.

One exciting direction in driven resonator systems is the design of **artificial gauge fields**—synthetic magnetic fields that act –break time-reversal symmetry– on neutral particles like photons or phonons. In contrast to electrons, these systems do not naturally react to magnetic field, so directional effects like the **Aharonov-Bohm phase** must be engineered through clever modulations in time or space. This opens the door to **nonreciprocal transport**, where energy flows preferentially in one direction, a key ingredient for next-generation quantum devices.

Artificial gauge fields can also be combined with **parametric interactions** (e.g. squeezing or gain) to access **non-Hermitian effects**. These appear in systems where there is **gain and loss**, meaning energy can enter or leave the system. This breaks the usual rules of standard (Hermitian) quantum mechanics and leads to new behavior. For example, signals can be **amplified in one direction only**, or two modes can merge at special points called **exceptional points**. These phenomena have no analog in traditional condensed matter systems and offer new ways to control signal flow and potentially, quantum states.
