#### Artificial Gauge Fields and Nonreciprocal Transport

**_Can we make light or sound behave as if they feel a magnetic field?_**

**_What happens when we break time symmetry to make energy flow in one direction?_**

**_How can gain, loss, and topology work together to control signals in quantum systems?_**

**Gauge fields** are at the heart of how we understand forces in nature—they describe how particles interact, from electromagnetism to the strong and weak nuclear forces. In condensed matter systems, **external gauge fields** like magnetic fields play a key role in shaping the behavior of electrons. A famous example is the **quantum Hall effect**, where applying a magnetic field to a two-dimensional electron gas leads to current flowing only along the edges, in one direction, while the bulk remains insulating. This remarkable behavior results from breaking **time-reversal symmetry** and gives rise to **topological edge states** that are robust against imperfections.

One exciting direction in driven resonator systems is the design of **artificial gauge fields**—synthetic magnetic fields that act –break time-reversal symmetry– on neutral particles like photons or phonons. In contrast to electrons, these systems do not naturally react to magnetic field, so directional effects like the **Aharonov-Bohm phase** must be engineered through clever modulations in time or space. This opens the door to **nonreciprocal transport**, where energy flows preferentially in one direction, a key ingredient for next-generation quantum devices.

Artificial gauge fields can also be combined with **parametric interactions** (e.g. squeezing or gain) to access **non-Hermitian effects**. These appear in systems where there is **gain and loss**, meaning energy can enter or leave the system. This breaks the usual rules of standard (Hermitian) quantum mechanics and leads to new behavior. For example, signals can be **amplified in one direction only**, or two modes can merge at special points called **exceptional points**. These phenomena have no analog in traditional condensed matter systems and offer new ways to control signal flow and potentially, quantum states.

This physics has been demonstrated and explored in several recent works:
