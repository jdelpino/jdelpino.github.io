Theoretical Quantum Physicist specialized in nanoscale light, sound, and matter interactions.

I have had the opportunity to delve into both classical and quantum many-body systems. My journey in this field has been enriched by a strong foundation in analytical skills and computational modeling. 

I am grateful for the learning experiences provided by the ETH Postdoctoral Fellowship, which supported some of my work and fostered valuable collaborations with experimental teams.

 My postdoctoral stint at the Photonic Forces experimental group at AMOLF, Amsterdam, allowed me to explore new realms in topological and nano-optomechanical networks. My Ph.D. research at UAM, Madrid, where I studied the intricate interactions between light and organic molecules, was a significant milestone in my academic journey.
