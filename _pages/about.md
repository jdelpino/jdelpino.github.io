<p>We are a newly established theory group in Quantum Engineering at the Condensed Matter Physics Center (IFIMAC), Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (UAM) [<a href="https://jdelpino.github.io/people/" target="_blank">People overview</a>].</p>

Our research focuses on driven dissipative systems, such as periodically-modulated nonlinear resonators and light matter platforms where collective, interacting topological phenomena emerge.</p> 

<p>We combine analytical insight with numerics to study how nonlinearity, gain, loss, and driving reshape dynamics far from equilibrium, connecting nonlinear dynamics with quantum many body physics. We work with models and questions that map directly onto real experimental platforms.

 See Selected Publications, below, and <a href="https://jdelpino.github.io/repositories/" target="_blank">Repositories</a> for details</p> <p>


<p><strong>About me.</strong> I am a Ramón y Cajal Researcher (tenure track) at IFIMAC, UAM. Previously, I was W2 Interim Professor at the University of Konstanz (2023 to 2025), and earlier an ETH Postdoctoral Fellow working closely with experimental groups at ETH Zürich and AMOLF in Amsterdam. I obtained my PhD at UAM on cavity QED with organic molecules.</p>

<p>A PhD position is currently open. Details are on the <a href="https://jdelpino.github.io/openings/" target="_blank">Openings page</a>.</p>
