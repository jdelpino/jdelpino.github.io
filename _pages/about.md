<p><strong>Theoretical Quantum Physicist</strong> specialized in nanoscale light, sound, and matter interactions. I am currently serving as a <strong>W2 Interim Professor</strong> at the University of Konstanz, Germany. 

In 2025, I will transition to a <strong>Ramón y Cajal Researcher (Tenure Track)</strong> at the Autonomous University of Madrid (UAM), where I will establish a new research group focused on <strong>Nonlinear Driven-Dissipative Phenomena</strong> and its ramifications into <strong>Topological and Quantum Many-Body Phenomena</strong>.</p>

<p>I have had the opportunity to delve into both classical and quantum many-body systems. My journey in this field has been enriched by a strong foundation in <em>analytical skills</em> and <em>computational modeling</em>.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the learning experiences provided by the <strong>ETH Postdoctoral Fellowship</strong>, which supported some of my work and fostered valuable collaborations with experimental teams.</p>

<p>My postdoctoral stint at the <em>Photonic Forces experimental group</em> at AMOLF, Amsterdam, allowed me to explore new realms in topological and nano-optomechanical networks. My Ph.D. research at UAM, Madrid, focused on studying strong coupling between light and organic molecules.</p>
