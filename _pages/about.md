<p><strong>Theoretical Quantum Physicist</strong> specialized in Quantum Engineering with driven-dissipative light-matter and mechanical systems.</p>

<p>I am starting as a <strong>Ramón y Cajal Researcher (Tenure Track)</strong> at the Condensed Matter Physics Center (IFIMAC) of the Autonomous University of Madrid (UAM), where I lead a new group focused on <strong>time-dependent nonlinear systems</strong> and their relevance to <strong>topological and quantum many-body phenomena</strong>.</p>

<p>I typically develop analytical and numerical methodologies to address problems in classical and quantum many-body physics (<a href="#publications">see Selected Publications, below, </a> and <a href="https://jdelpino.github.io/repositories/" target="_blank">Repositories</a> for details).</p>

<p>Between 2023 and 2025, I served as a <strong>W2 Interim Professor</strong> at the University of Konstanz, Germany.</p>

<p>Earlier, the <strong>ETH Postdoctoral Fellowship</strong> supported my research and collaborations with experimental teams.</p>

<p>During my postdoc at AMOLF (Photonic Forces group), I explored topological and nano-optomechanical networks. My Ph.D. at UAM focused on strong coupling between light and organic molecules.</p>
