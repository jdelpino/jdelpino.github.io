<p>I am starting as a <strong>Ramón y Cajal Researcher (Tenure Track)</strong> at the Condensed Matter Physics Center (IFIMAC), Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (UAM). I lead a new group in Quantum Engineering with driven-dissipative light-matter and mechanical systems. We focus on <strong>time-dependent nonlinear resonators</strong> and their role in <strong>topological and quantum many-body phenomena</strong>.</p>

<p>Part of my work involves developing semi-analytical and numerical tools for classical and quantum many-body physics. (<a href="#publications">see Selected Publications, below, </a> and <a href="https://jdelpino.github.io/repositories/" target="_blank">Repositories</a> for details).</p>

<p>Between 2023 and 2025, I served as a <strong>W2 Interim Professor</strong> at the University of Konstanz, Germany.</p>

<p>I was an <strong>ETH Postdoctoral Fellow</strong>, working closely with experimental groups at ETH Zürich, Switzerland. Before that, I explored theory and experiments in topological nano-optomechanical systems at AMOLF in Amsterdam. My Ph.D. at UAM focused on cavity QED with organic molecules. More details are available on the <a href="https://jdelpino.github.io/cv/" target="_blank">CV page</a>.</p>
