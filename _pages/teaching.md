As a W2 Interim Professor at the University of Konstanz, my teaching philosophy is rooted in active student engagement and practical application of theoretical concepts. Below are the courses I am currently teaching:

### Computational Approaches to Quantum Oscillators (Winter Semester 2023-24)
This Master's course provides an in-depth exploration of quantum oscillators, pivotal in various technologies from quantum sensing to computing. Key topics include:
- Effects of time-dependent forces on oscillators (amplification, cooling, coupling)
- Utilizing computational tools like Python's **QuTiP** and Julia Notebooks' **QuantumOptics.jl**
- Simulation and analysis of quantum dynamics

The course adopts a **"flipped classroom"** approach, encouraging students to actively participate, work collaboratively, and seek guidance as needed.

### Seminar: Computational Methods for Quantum Optics
This seminar offers an immersive experience in quantum optics through:
- Critical discussion and analysis of research papers
- Hands-on creation of presentations
- Focusing on quantum optics problems solvable on classical computers
- Adopting a **"reproducible journal club"** style

Students engage deeply with the subject matter, enhancing their understanding through presentations backed by reproducible computational notebooks.
