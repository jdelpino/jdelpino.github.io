Explore the materials for courses I have taught, delving into Quantum Oscillators, Quantum Optics and Computational Many-Body Physics. In my lectures, I prioritize active student engagement and practical application of theoretical concepts. Current and recent courses include:

### Modelling Quantum Hardware: Open Dynamics and Control [Univ.of Konstanz] (Winter Semester '24-25)
This course focuses on the **principles and control of quantum hardware platforms** essential for advancing quantum technologies. Topics include:  
- Quantum hardware platforms (atomic clouds, ion traps, photons, superconducting circuits) and methods for quantum state manipulation (cooling, squeezing, coupling).  
- Applications in synthetic quantum matter, emergent phenomena, chemical reaction simulations, and quantum tools (e.g., sensors, amplifiers for LIGO).  
- Nonlinear dynamics in coupled resonators to model complex hardware behavior.  
- Practical training in entanglement, decoherence, many-body interactions, and error correction, with Python and Julia programming.  

### Computational Quantum Physics [Univ.of Konstanz] (Summer Semester '23-24)
This course offers a deep dive into quantum mechanics and computational methods. Topics include:
- Foundational aspects of wavefunctions and the Schr√∂dinger equation for **quantum many-body systems** such as spin models. 
- **Computational techniques**: exact diagonalization, matrix product states, and Monte Carlo methods for spin systems and quantum particles. 
- Overview of quantum computation in variational quantum eigensolvers.
- Neural networks for analyzing quantum data, blending theory with hands-on computational approaches.


### Computational Approaches to Quantum Oscillators [Univ. of Konstanz] (Winter Semester '22-23)
This course provides an in-depth exploration of quantum oscillators, pivotal in various technologies from quantum sensing to computing. Key topics include:
- Effects of time-dependent forces on oscillators (amplification, cooling, coupling)
- Use of computational tools like Python's **QuTiP** and Julia Notebooks' **QuantumOptics.jl**
- Simulation and analysis of quantum dynamics

The course adopts a **flipped classroom** approach, encouraging students to actively participate, work collaboratively, and seek guidance as needed.

### Seminar: Computational Methods for Quantum Optics [University of Konstanz] (Winter Semester '22-23)
This seminar offers an immersive experience in quantum optics through:
- Critical discussion and analysis of research papers
- Hands-on creation of presentations
- Focusing on quantum optics problems solvable on classical computers
- Adopting a **"reproducible journal club"** style

Students engage deeply with the subject matter, enhancing their understanding through presentations backed by reproducible computational notebooks.
