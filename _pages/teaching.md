As an Interim Professor at the University of Konstanz, I prioritize active student engagement and practical application of theoretical concepts. Current and recent courses include:


### Computational Quantum Physics [University of Konstanz] (Summmer Semester 2024-25)
This course offers a deep dive into quantum mechanics and computational methods. Topics include:
- Foundational aspects of wavefunctions and the Schr√∂dinger equation for quantum many-body systems such as spin models. 
- Computational techniques: exact diagonalization, matrix product states, and Monte Carlo methods for spin systems and quantum particles. 
- Overview of quantum computation in variational quantum eigensolvers.
- Neural networks for analyzing quantum data, blending theory with hands-on computational approaches.


### Computational Approaches to Quantum Oscillators [University of Konstanz] (Winter Semester 2023-24 & 2024-25)
This course provides an in-depth exploration of quantum oscillators, pivotal in various technologies from quantum sensing to computing. Key topics include:
- Effects of time-dependent forces on oscillators (amplification, cooling, coupling)
- Use of computational tools like Python's **QuTiP** and Julia Notebooks' **QuantumOptics.jl**
- Simulation and analysis of quantum dynamics

The course adopts a **"flipped classroom"** approach, encouraging students to actively participate, work collaboratively, and seek guidance as needed.

### Seminar: Computational Methods for Quantum Optics [University of Konstanz] (Winter Semester 2023-24 & 2024-25)
This seminar offers an immersive experience in quantum optics through:
- Critical discussion and analysis of research papers
- Hands-on creation of presentations
- Focusing on quantum optics problems solvable on classical computers
- Adopting a **"reproducible journal club"** style

Students engage deeply with the subject matter, enhancing their understanding through presentations backed by reproducible computational notebooks.
