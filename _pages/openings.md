### PhD Opportunity: Time-Dependent Quantum Systems and Nonreciprocal Phenomena

---

**_How can you realize and observe quantum states that do not exist in equilibrium?_**  
**_What new physics emerges when systems are driven in time and subject to strong interactions and dissipation?_**  
**_How can topology help us distinguish and conceive new phases of matter?_**

Time-dependent quantum systems are opening new frontiers in the design of quantum matter. By modulating systems in time — and combining this with interactions and dissipation — it becomes possible to stabilize and control quantum states that cannot be accessed in static conditions.

One powerful phenomenon that can be engineered in this context is **nonreciprocity**, where energy propagates preferentially in one direction (see [arXiv:2110.14710](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14710) or [arXiv:2207.08523v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08523)). This directional behavior is key for emerging **artificial materials** and **quantum devices** such as isolators or amplifiers, and raises deep questions at the interface of **quantum optics**, **condensed matter**, and **nonequilibrium physics**.

I am starting a new research group in 2025, funded by a **Ramón y Cajal fellowship**, and I am looking for a PhD student to join me in exploring these ideas.

### Project Description

The project will focus on **time-dependent nonlinear quantum systems** in light-matter and nanomechanical platforms.

You will contribute to:
- The development and use of **semianalytical methods**, such as harmonic balance techniques ([arXiv:2202.00571](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00571), [HarmonicBalance.jl docs](https://juliapackages.com/p/harmonicbalance))
- **Numerical tools**, including tensor network techniques ([arXiv:1804.04511](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04511), [arXiv:1807.00586](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00586))  
to study driven-dissipative many-body dynamics.

This is a **theoretical project**, but collaboration with experimental groups will be encouraged. Attendance to international schools and workshops will be supported.

### Candidate Profile

Looking for candidates with:
- A strong background in **quantum mechanics** or **condensed matter physics**
- Solid **programming** and **analytical skills** (essential)
- Experience in **scientific computing** or **numerical modeling** is a plus
- Independence, curiosity, and high motivation

**Women are especially encouraged to apply, in line with our commitment to diversity in science.**
