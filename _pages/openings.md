### Open Positions

### PhD Opening: Nonlinear Quantum Dynamics in Driven-Dissipative Systems 

...

**_How can you realize and observe quantum states that do not exist in equilibrium?_** 

**_What new physics emerges when systems are driven and subject to nonlinearity, interaction and dissipation?_**  

**_How can topology help us distinguish and conceive new phases of matter?_**

Time-dependent quantum systems are opening new frontiers in the design of quantum matter. By modulating systems in time it becomes possible to stabilize and control quantum states that cannot be accessed in static conditions.

One powerful phenomenon that can be engineered in this context is **nonreciprocity**, where energy propagates preferentially in one direction (see [arXiv:2110.14710](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14710) or [arXiv:2207.08523v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08523)). This directional behavior is key for emerging **artificial materials** and **quantum devices** such as isolators or amplifiers. A prevalent feature in these systems is **nonlinearity**, which enriches their dynamics by introducing interactions and enabling a broad range of collective phenomena. This raises deep questions at the interface of **quantum optics**, **condensed matter**, and **nonequilibrium physics**.

I am starting a new research group in 2025, funded by a **Ramón y Cajal fellowship**, and I am looking for a PhD student to join me in exploring these ideas.

#### Project Description

The project will focus on **time-dependent nonlinear quantum systems**. Suited for students who are excited by fundamental questions and enjoy combining physical insight with analytical and computational tools.
You will contribute to research efforts that may include:

- Driven-dissipative many-body dynamics. Discovery of stabilized states of matter (e.g. solitons, superradiant states, limit cycles...) and retrieval of their experimental signatures.
- Development and use of tools based on **semianalytical and numerical methods**, such as harmonic balance ([arXiv:2202.00571](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00571), [HarmonicBalance.jl docs](https://juliapackages.com/p/harmonicbalance)) tensor network techniques ([arXiv:1804.04511](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04511), [arXiv:1807.00586](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00586)) and topological methods. 
- The exploration of symmetry-breaking mechanisms (e.g. artificial magnetic fields) to induce and control topological effects in light-matter and nanomechanical platforms.
 ([arXiv:2406.16591](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16591))
 
 This is a **theoretical project**, but collaboration with experimental groups will be encouraged. Attendance to national/international schools and workshops will be supported.
